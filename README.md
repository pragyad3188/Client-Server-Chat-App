## Introduction
A simple client server chat application using socket programming which has support for multiple clients

A network protocol is a set of rules that defines how data is transmitted among devices in same network. We here discuss two of the important network protocols, namely - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). 
TCP is a connection oriented protocol ( a connection must be established between the devices before the start of communication (the 3 way handshake) and must close after it is completed) while this is not the case with UDP. Due to this feature as well as it's error checking and acknowledging mechanisms , TCP is more reliable than UDP.
